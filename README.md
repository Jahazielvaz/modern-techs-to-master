## INSPIRATION
I'm looking to build powerful and modern projects. I have taken big lapses in my programming journey. I wish to dive in and master this field, not just to develop my career, but as a subset for my business, and my hacking journey. I'm missing some vital knowledge, and the purpose of this project is to develop said knowledge. You will find a list of areas in which I will focus on improving, in the next heading.

## AREAS OF FOCUS
This are the areas in which I look to get really good, to excel as a developer

### Modern Technologie:
This means modern to me. Many of these technologies are not even very new, but they're an upgrade and new to me, and they focus on quality of life, or performance improvement, or greater automation. This list will be every updating as I technology and my skills progress
- VS Code Editor: Most power developers recommend this TE. and I know it has some powerful features, so I need to do a TE overhaul
- Typescript: For greater browser compatibility, as well as better debugging, and cleaner live environment
- Vite: For faster, leaner compiling, as opposed to webstorm, or other more dated technologies.
- Garbage collection: Understanding memory efficiency for better performance.
- CSS UPDATE OVERHAUL Need a refresher on css grid, Material Design (Googles. Combiines css n js for faster and intuitive implementation), Material UI (To work with react components. For easier and more seamless compatibility and execution), SCSS (This will be my go to vanilla option)
- React Hooks
- Redux
- Mongo DB: I already know a good chunk, but I keep getting stuck at the db lvl. I seem to be hitting bugs that prevent me from posting or updating db. After I learn ts and vite, I will learn the modern parts I'm missing about mongoose n mongo db atlas, until I'm able to have the ability to create working rest apis.


### Current Focus:
These are the technologies I'm currently focusing on.
- Typescript
- Vite
